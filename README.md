## Trabalhos da Cadeira de Redes Neurais
### 1. SVM
  * Support Vector Machines:
  Hand-coding a SVM based on SMO algorithm
### 2. SOM
  * Kohonen Map
### 3. Q-Learning
  * Online Q-learning algorithm for reducing energy comsuption on a Base Station for Mobile Networks.
  * Based on the paper "Reinforcement learning approach to dynamic activation of base station resources in wireless networks." by Peng-Yong Kong and Dorin Panaitopol on Personal Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), 2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on. IEEE, 2013.
#### Todo list:
  * Implement new epsilon-greedy approach.
  * Change the traffic model.
  * Implement a new state space including a state for more users than supported by the system.
